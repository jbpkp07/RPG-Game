# RPG-Game

Fun Star Wars themed RPG game.

Choose your own adventure, style!

Pick your player, and choose your opponents wisely...

Developed with a combination of HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript, and some JQuery sprinkled in.

Instead of using a heavy Oject-Oriented approach, I wrote this attempting a much more procedural approach.

(I normally am hardcore object-oriented!)
